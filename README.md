- José Gaspar Uh Martin
- Santiago López Puc
- Pablo Jonathan Dzul Verde

### Introduction
*Vacations are a time of fun and relaxation, so why is planning them so tedious?*
Under that question, "Turizimín" was born, a project that seeks to use the power of Artificial Intelligence to create the perfect itinerary for an ideal vacation.

### Users
The potential users contemplating the project are mainly:

***Primary***
- Tourists and travelers from all over the world who seek to optimize their trips
- Travel services or schools that organize trips
***Secondary***
- Companies or sites of interest that want to promote themselves

### Innovation
What differentiates Turizimín from other similar Apps/Websites? Well, although there are hundreds of other services that allow you to create itineraries, few of them really automate the process to make it easier for the user to design their trip in a really simple way, with Turizimín we also seek to improve user-AI communication so that the result is the most accurate possible without the user having to make complex descriptions to the system

### Product Evolution

Initially, the development team defined the Functional and Non-Functional Requirements, taking them as a basis, the team proceeded to create the Use Cases and User Stories. We also decided to use Kanban as our agile methodology due to its flexibility and its basis in continuous work but limited, which together allows us to work even faster and more freely than with other agile methodologies such as Scrum.
During the second stage, several elements of this were designed, culminating in the beginning of the construction of a low-fidelity prototype in Figma.
For the third stage, the focus was on completing a more advanced prototype to subsequently carry out tests with it to ensure its quality and compliance with the established requirements.
As umbrella activities, in each delivery we review (and rewrite if necessary) the requirements and other artifacts to ensure their quality.

### Requirements
At the beginning of the project we defined the list of requirements for the software, however during the development many changes were made, removing some requirements considered unnecessary and editing others to adapt to the needs and characteristics of the final product, as well as the order of Priority of requirements was changed to give more importance to those vital for functional and quality software.

#### Final Version
- [Functional Requirements](/Requerimientos/Requerimientos-F.md)
- [Non-Functional Requirements](/Requerimientos/Requerimientos-NF.md)
- [Non-Functional Requirements Diagram](/Requerimientos/Diagrama-Requerimientos-NF.pdf)

- [Use Cases](/Requerimientos/CasosUso-HistoriasUsuario/DiagramaCasosUso.pdf)
- [User Stories](/Requerimientos/CasosUso-HistoriasUsuario/HistoriasUsuario.pdf)

### Design and Prototyping

The project prototype was designed in the website Figma, in this stage it was improved to be more advanced and in line with the requirements.

### Software Testing

A single unit test was carried out, focused on analyzing the operation and usability of the system, as well as reviewing the user interface through an exploration of the prototype for all its options.

### Process

##### Develop Management

In the second stage we make estimates of costs, time and effort using COSMIC, we use this algorithmic model due to its relative ease of application and precision in this specific situation compared to models like COCOMO or expert based.

##### Work Management

For better team management we use Trello boards to define roles, tasks and due dates, we also use GanttProject to create Gantt charts to organize the latest on a timeline and thus have a visual way to see delivery times, Finally, we created rubrics for the meetings where we recorded all the information discussed in them.

#### Competencies

##### Generic
- *Communicates in Spanish orally and in writing in his professional interventions and his personal life using the language correctly*

	We applied this competence when making the delivery video of stage 1 and 2, as well as when writing the script of that presentations.

- *Uses ICT in their professional interventions and their personal life in a pertinent and responsible manner.*

	To carry out all the parts of this delivery we apply several ICT tools, from Markdown text editors like Obsidian to design and prototyping websites like Figma.

- *Manage knowledge in your professional interventions and in your personal life, in a pertinent manner.*

	We apply what we learned in the course during the development of the project, from requirement engineer to software project management topics, interface design (FrontEnd), cost and work calculation, etc.

- *Make decisions in your professional and personal practice, responsibly.*

	It is demonstrated throughout the entire development, when deciding from job roles based on skills to time management to deliver on time without exaggerating the workload.

##### Specific

- *Analyzes the main methods, techniques, procedures and good practices used in the software requirements, design, coding, testing and maintenance phases, in accordance with the body of knowledge recognized by the discipline.*

	During the project we apply the knowledge acquired during the semester, from requirements engineering, the different branches of design, development life cycle models, testing techniques, among other knowledge of the discipline.

- *Select the Software Life Cycle Model at the beginning of a project, based on the characteristics of the development team, the client and the problem.*

	During the project we decided on the ideal life cycle model for it (which is the Waterfall Model combined with certain aspects of Evolutionary Prototyping) based on its characteristics.

- *Analyzes the main methods, techniques, procedures, and good practices used in the estimation, planning, monitoring, control, quality, and software configuration processes, in accordance with the body of knowledge recognized by the discipline.*

	In the project we apply several methods and processes to plan the work and make cost and effort estimates.

### Constructive Criticism
We consider that the course was quite well carried out, the topics are well explained, the materials are very complete and the project is an excellent way to apply the knowledge learned in the classes.
However, there are certain things that we want to mention about the course, mainly about the hybrid mode, it seems to us that this mode, although it can be useful, has problems, mainly the quality of the transmission, since it influences the concentration of students and low audio quality causes it to be lost.
Furthermore, although we said that the materials were very complete, they have errors in writing, formatting or structuring of the information, we recommend a better review of the presentations, as an extra we also suggest a better design for them.
We have no extra activities to recommend.
